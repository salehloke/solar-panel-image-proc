# Solar Panel Dirt Detection System - Progress Report

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a system for detecting dirt on solar panels using deep learning. The system processes solar panel images and classifies them as either "clean" or "dirty", which can help in maintenance scheduling and efficiency monitoring.

## Current Architecture

The project is organized into three main components:

1. **Data Processing**: The original setup with code for dataset preparation and training
2. **PyTorch Module**: A new component for model definition and training
3. **FastAPI Backend**: A REST API for serving model predictions

## Implemented Features

### 1. Data Processing (Existing)
- Dataset loading in `src/data/dataset.py`
- Training script in `src/train.py`

### 2. PyTorch Module (New)
- `pytorch/models/resnet_model.py`: ResNet18-based classifier for solar panel images
- Model creation, saving, and loading utilities
- Integration layer with the FastAPI backend

### 3. FastAPI Backend (New)
- API for solar panel image classification
- Image upload and prediction endpoints
- Integration with the PyTorch model
- Health check endpoint
- Interactive API documentation via Swagger UI

## Integration Strategy

The system uses a clean integration between the PyTorch module and FastAPI backend:

1. The PyTorch module (`pytorch/`) defines the model architecture and provides training utilities
2. The integration module (`pytorch/integration.py`) serves as a bridge between the model and the API
3. The FastAPI backend (`backend/`) loads the trained model and serves predictions via REST API

This separation of concerns allows for:
- Independent development of the model and API
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Flexibility to swap different model architectures without changing the API

## Next Steps

1. **Training Pipeline**:
   - Complete the data preparation pipeline
   - Train the ResNet18 model using the existing training data
   - Save the trained model to the `models/` directory

2. **API Enhancements**:
   - Add user authentication
   - Implement batch processing for multiple images
   - Add detailed model metrics and explanations

3. **Deployment**:
   - Containerize both the PyTorch and FastAPI components
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Deploy to production environment

4. **User Interface**:
   - Create a frontend web application for easy interaction with the API
   - Add visualization for model predictions

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following main dependencies:
- PyTorch and torchvision for the deep learning model
- FastAPI for the REST API
- Pillow for image processing
- uvicorn for the ASGI server

All dependencies are specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
